== PROJECT: MakerManager
== Overview
This document is meant for recording the contributions I have committed and the role played in the developing of this project.

MakerManger is a free, open-sourced desktop application developed to improve the efficiency of existing facilities at makerspace at SoC. Currently, the facilities are mostly 3D printers.
Without the traditional tedious and complicated method of managing the usage of the facilities, MakerManger provides a real-time list and appended job queue for each. Algorithms are also able to provide the tasking method which consumes least time.

In abstract, MakerManager has these features: +
* A 2-level access system, for the normal users and lab managers. +
* Normal users can add jobs to specified machines or let the system help them allocate to the most free one. +
* Admin users can register/deregister machines, manage job queues of machines. +
* All users can monitor the status of machines and printing progress of all jobs.

== Summary of contributions
* *Major enhancement*: added *Job class and relevant classes in storage and UI component*
** What it does: allows the developers to work on these components to add more features.
** Justification: These classes are crucial to MakerManager, as all the features related to jobs are based on them.
** Credits: The development of version 1.0 is done fully by me. Later on, Teo Jun Jie (one of our team member) fixed some bugs of the integration with the storage component and UI component. After that, I picked up and added some small changes.
** View on: https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-T09-1/main/pull/4[PR#4] and https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-T09-1/main/pull/27[PR#27]

* *Major enhancement*: added *addJob command*
** What it does: allows the user to add a job with specified name and priority to the job list.
** Justification: This feature is one of the key features of MakerManger. Without this, users will not be able to add any jobs to any machine.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: The development of version 1.0 is done fully by me. Later on, Teo Jun Jie (one of our team member) fixed some bugs of the integration with the storage component and UI component. After that, I picked up and added some small changes.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the findJob, listJobs command for users to locate a job by name. https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-T09-1/main/pull/50[PR#50]

* *Minor enhancement*: implemented the TimeStamp object for version 1.0. TimeStamp was refactored by Sean. https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-T09-1/main/pull/77[PR#77]

* *Minor enhancement*: refactored all the codes and removed all the irrelevant person class. https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-T09-1/main/pull/154[PR#154]
