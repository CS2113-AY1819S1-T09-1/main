MakerManager was developed by the https://github.com/NUSCS2113-T09-1[T09-1] team, as part of CS2113T - a Software
Engineering module. +

We are a team based in the http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].
At the time of writing, all 4 of us are Computer Engineering students in our Sophomore year.

== Project Team
Everyone in the team implemented a hand full of features that went together to create MakerManager. Everyone was involved in writing
code for the full stack, documentation and testing. Other than that, each of us had special roles and responsibilities.
