== Introduction
MakerManager is for people who prefer using a desktop app for managing time-shared equipment in a makerspace. Furthermore, MakerManager is optimized for those who prefer working with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MakerManager can get your machine management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed on your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your MakerManager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`listMachines`* : lists all machines
* **`addJob`**`n/iDCP m/TYPrinter on/TIAN YUAN pr/HIGH d/1.5 jn/This is for the iDCP project t/iDCP` : adds a Job named `iDCP` to the MakerManager.
* **`manageJob`**`iDCP start` : starts a Job named `iDCP`
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
